When I started programming, the Internet appeared. 
I asked a friend "how to install Yahoo" :)
It's not a problem if you don't know something, 
each of us once didn't know something, even today. 
The problem is if you don't want to learn.

When I had my first programming exam at the university, 
I asked professor Litovski to check my work, 
so that I would know if I should study for the oral exam. 
He quickly looked at my solution and said "you failed". 
I asked him to take another look, because I'm sure I didn't.
Two days later, I got a score of 10, the highest possible.
I didn't solve the task the way he taught us. 
I found another, better way.
That is me. 
Whoever likes the way I think, ok, whoever not likes, ok too.
